JavaScript Course assignment for Frontend Development course at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

About:

This course assignment is made from prevous HTML and CSS assignment.

Goal
Using your new skills writing JavaScript, create an interactive online store to display
product from an API endpoint. Use one of the three provided API urls to display
products in HTML and allow users to create a basket of items.
You may use your existing cross course project code as a starting point, or start a
fresh project if this is not available. We recommend using an existing project as
styling will not be graded, but is nice to have in the final submission.

Reflection:
It has been challanging to follow along with the lesson when things were not put into context or projects. I used example from JS-foxxy lesson and a lot of help from youtube videos to follow along and things finally fell into places and made more sense.
