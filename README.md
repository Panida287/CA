Course assignment for HTML and CSS course for Frontend Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## About:

This project was part of the course assignment, at the end of the HTML and CSS course in the first semester of Front End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.
The design of this project is based on the design I made for the course assignment, at the end of the Design course, during the first semester.

## Requirements:
The course assignment had the following requirements:
  * The HTML should be semantic and neatly formatted.
  * The CSS should follow the DRY principles and be easy to read-The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. PLease do no use a CSS framework like Bootstrap; we want to see that you can build responsive websites without the use of a framework.
  * The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
  * Each page should have a unique \<meta name="description">, <title> and \<h1>.
  * You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by yourself, You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, which should be included in your report.

## Process:
I started by analizing each page and plan my approach how I want to structer it.
I ended up using a lot of grids within grids and flex within grids, since I found them to be very easy in term of making the website responsive.
Added alt text to every image for better accessibility.
Tried to make the links as clear as possible.

## Features
The page is deployed at Netlify : https://panidas-ca.netlify.app/

The page consists of 8 pages:
  * Home
  * Browse page
  * Movie detail page
  * Cart
  * Checkout
  * Checkout success
  * Contact page
  * About page

### Reflection:
Although we have learned a lot in class and self-study, it was a challenge to put all the knowledge together into actual coding. And with so many approch for the same result, it was pretty overwhelming at the first 2 pages. 

but I feel a lot smarter as I finished the last page and things didn't take as long anymore. I felt like codes were flying out of me.
Overall, I learned so much just by coding this one website!.
