Process:
I started by analizing each page and plan my approach how I want to structer it. I ended up using a lot of grids within grids and flex within grids, since I found them to be very easy in term of making the website responsive. Added alt text to every image for better accessibility. Tried to make the links as clear as possible.

Reflection:
Although we have learned a lot in class and self-study, it was a challenge to put all the knowledge together into actual coding. And with so many approch for the same result, it was pretty overwhelming at the first 2 pages.

but I feel a lot smarter as I finished the last page and things didn't take as long anymore. I felt like codes were flying out of me. Overall, I learned so much just by coding this one website!.
